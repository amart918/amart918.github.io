        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Social WorkðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My career as a social worker will allow me to provide assistance to individuals, families and communities that arenâ€™t able to access the basic services in their communities. I provide solutions to psycho-social problems in a way that allows my clients to cope with their accumulated stress and any  other mental health issues that may be affecting their everyday routines. I make sure that I am actively listening to my clients because if I want to provide the best service, I need to be able to know how to help them construct and manage the source of the problems. I make it my mission to advocate and help establish social policies and service programs that will help my clients access their basic needs. When working with individuals and families, I need to assess the problems and needs of my clients by counseling them about coping strategies that can help them. If they require social services for low-income families then I make sure to provide them with resources like food stamps and housing. 
<br><br>
        In the worst case scenarios, I might have to intervene in overly dangerous situations such as suicide attempts or child abuse. Acting as an intervening factor in these situations is a way to protect and support these individuals and families. In groups, I need to be able to facilitate counseling services which require me to speak to large groups of people such as educational seminars which need someone to talk about the importance of violence prevention or substance abuse. As an advocate for society I work directly with communities by organizing ways to address social issues that require policies to be changed because they might not be giving a fair advantage to members of those communities. If I were to work somewhere outside of the United States as an international social worker I might have to collaborate directly with community leaders to work towards a plan for basic necessities to be accessible to members of the community. This is probably the hardest part as a social worker working in another country. 
<br><br> 
        As a social worker I need to be open to the idea of collaborating with other professionals such as doctors or social service workers because this is another way I can provide the best services and advocate for my clients needs. My major as a sociology undergraduate student teaches me about the social structure and cultural norms of communities which help social workers to understand the root of the causes for most of the social issues that arise at a systemic level rather than solely focusing on a particular individual. By learning about the power dynamics, discrimination, and privileges within society it can help social workers understand how to advocate for marginalized groups that arenâ€™t being represented. This will help social workers construct social institutions that will bring awareness about the harmful stereotypes and biases that surround disadvantageous communities. In order to enhance interpersonal skills, collaborating and working with others will always help social workers build bonding relationships with individuals, communicate more effectively, and work better with diverse communities.
